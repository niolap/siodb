# User Documentation

We write the user documentation in Markdown.
Then you can build the user documentation with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Install mkdocs

Refer to the [mkdocs Installation Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).

## Preview user documentation

You can view the result of your change before committing with `mkdocs`.
For instance, following will launch a web server to preview your docs as you work:

```bash
cd docs/users
mkdocs serve
```
